CondVar Test:                                                           
                                                                        
Simple test creates several local and global threads; half use a single,
shared condvar, and the other half have their own condvar.  The main    
thread then loops notifying them to wakeup.                             
                                                                        
The timeout test is very similar except that the threads are not        
notified.  They will all wakeup on a 1 second timeout.                  
                                                                        
The mixed test combines the simple test and the timeout test; every     
third thread is notified, the other threads are expected to timeout     
correctly.                                                              
                                                                        
Lastly, the combined test creates a thread for each of the above three  
cases and they all run simultaneously.                                  
                                                                        
This test is run with 5, 10, 15, and 20 threads of each type.

CondVar Test:                                                           
                                                                        
Simple test creates several local and global threads; half use a single,
shared condvar, and the other half have their own condvar.  The main    
thread then loops notifying them to wakeup.                             
                                                                        
The timeout test is very similar except that the threads are not        
notified.  They will all wakeup on a 1 second timeout.                  
                                                                        
The mixed test combines the simple test and the timeout test; every     
third thread is notified, the other threads are expected to timeout     
correctly.                                                              
                                                                        
Lastly, the combined test creates a thread for each of the above three  
cases and they all run simultaneously.                                  
                                                                        
This test is run with 5, 10, 15, and 20 threads of each type.
